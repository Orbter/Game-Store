## Description

This application demonstrates how to:

- Use **React** for building reusable UI components  
- Configure **React Router** for navigating between different pages  
- Manage state effectively for loading states, error handling, and dynamic data  
- Handle both **success** and **error** scenarios when fetching resources  
- Organize file structure and best practices for a React-based project  

## Features

1. **Home Page** – Displays a list of available games.  
2. **Game Details Page** – Shows detailed information about each game.  
3. **404 Error Page** – Graceful handling of any unknown routes.  
4. **Loading Indicators** – Display loading screens while data is being fetched.  

## What I Learned

1. **React Router**  
   - Creating routes for different pages  
   - Navigating between components and passing dynamic parameters  
   - Setting up a 404 or error page for unknown routes  

2. **State Management**  
   - Using React's built-in hooks like `useState` and `useEffect` to manage and track component state  
   - Handling loading states to provide a better user experience  
   - Displaying fallback UI when data fails to load or fetch errors occur  

3. **Error Handling**  
   - Implementing try/catch blocks and conditional rendering when APIs fail  
   - Redirecting users to an error or fallback page in case of errors  

4. **Project Structure & Organization**  
   - Separating components into reusable pieces  
   - Keeping routes, views, components, and assets organized  

5. **Deployment**  
   - Deploying a React app to GitHub Pages, ensuring the site is accessible to everyone
